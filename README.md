# Anomaly Detection using Autoencoder Neural Networks

Autoencoders are deep neural networks that learn to predict compressed versions of their inputs. ``` model.fit(x_train, x_train) ```  
The number of neurons in the middle layers are usually set to be fewer than the number of input neurons, so that the network learns just the *essential* information in the inputs.

Application areas include Anomaly Detection, Image Denoising, etc.
